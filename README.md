# claude-starter-kit

Starter template repo for all your Claude Code needs

## About

This is a starter template repository designed to provide a complete development environment for Claude-Code with pre-configured MCP servers and tools for AI-powered development workflows. The repository is intentionally minimal, containing only configuration templates for three primary systems: Claude Code, Serena, and Task Master.

## Features

- **🤖 Four Pre-Configured MCP Servers**
  - **Context7**: Up-to-date library documentation and code examples
  - **Serena**: Semantic code analysis with LSP integration for intelligent navigation
  - **Task Master**: AI-powered task management and workflow orchestration
  - **Zen**: Multi-model AI integration for debugging, code review, and planning

- **⚙️ Automated Template Cleanup**
  - GitHub Actions workflow for one-click repository initialization
  - Configurable inputs for language detection and Task Master settings
  - Automatic cleanup of template-specific files for a clean starting point

- **📋 50+ Task Master Slash Commands**
  - Pre-configured hierarchical command structure under `/project:tm/`
  - Commands for task management, complexity analysis, PRD parsing, and workflows
  - Complete command reference in `.claude/TM_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md`

- **🔍 Intelligent Code Navigation**
  - Serena's symbol-based code analysis for efficient exploration
  - Token-efficient reading with overview and targeted symbol queries
  - Reference tracking and semantic understanding across your codebase

- **📝 Configuration Templates**
  - Ready-to-use templates for `.serena/`, `.taskmaster/`, and `.claude/` directories
  - Placeholder-based customization with repository-specific values
  - Permission configuration for tool access control

- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Project-level `CLAUDE.md` with integration guidance
  - Task Master integration guide with 400+ lines of best practices
  - Complete workflow specification and command references

## Requirements

You will need the following on your workstation:

### Tools

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### API Keys

- [Context7](https://context7.com/) API key
- Gemini API key for [zen-mcp-server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server). You don't need to use gemini and can configure zen with any other provider/models. See [zen getting started docs](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) for more details.

### Claude `claude.json` mcp settings

You need to have `mcpServers` present and configured in your `~/.claude.json`. 
The reason we put them in the user's claude.json configuration, instead of repo local settings, is for reusability across projects, and to prevent committing API keys, which some MPC servers might require.

Here's an example `mcpServers` object that you can use as a reference:

```json
{
  "context7": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_CONTEXT7_API_KEY"
    }
  },
  "serena": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "--from",
      "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",
      "serena",
      "start-mcp-server",
      "--context",
      "ide-assistant",
      "--project",
      "."
    ],
    "env": {}
  },
  "task-master-ai": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "--package=task-master-ai",
      "task-master-ai"
    ],
    "headers": {}
  },
  "zen": {
    "command": "sh",
    "args": [
      "-c",
      "uvx --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server.git zen-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {
      "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:~/.local/bin",
      # see https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#model-configuration
      "DEFAULT_MODEL": "auto",

      "DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP": "high",
      "GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
      # see https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#model-usage-restrictions
      "GOOGLE_ALLOWED_MODELS": "gemini-2.5-pro,gemini-2.5-flash"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

1. [Create a new project based on this template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=claude-starter-kit&template_owner=serpro69) using the Use this template button. 

2. A scaffold repo will appear in your GitHub account.

3. Run the `template-cleanup` workflow from your new repo, and provide some inputs for your specific use-case.

**Serena MCP Configuration Inputs:**

- `LANGUAGE` - the main language(s) of your project (see [Serena Programming Language Support & Semantic Analysis Capabilities](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-language-support--semantic-analysis-capabilities) for more details on supported languages)

- `SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT` - initial prompt for the project; it will always be given to the LLM upon activating the project

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at serena [project.yaml](./.github/templates/serena/project.yml) configuration file for more details.

**Task-Master MCP Configuration Inputs:**

- `TM_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - custom system prompt to override Claude Code's default behavior

- `TM_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - append additional content to the system prompt

- `TM_PERMISSION_MODE` - permission mode for file system operations

> [!TIP]
> See [Task Master Advanced Claude Code Settings Usage](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/blob/main/docs/examples/claude-code-usage.md#advanced-settings-usage) for more details on the above parameters.

4. Clone your new repo and cd into it

    Run `claude /mcp`, you should see the mcp servers configured and active:

    ```
    > /mcp
    ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Manage MCP servers                                                 │
    │                                                                    │
    │ ❯ 1. context7                  ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
    │   2. serena                    ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
    │   3. task-master-ai            ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
    │   4. zen                       ✔ connected · Enter to view details │
    ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    Run `claude "list your skills"`, you should see the skills from this repo present:

    ```
    > list your skills

    ● I have access to the following skills:

      Available Skills

      analysis-process
      Turn the idea for a feature into a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and implementation-plan. Use in pre-implementation (idea-to-design) stages to make sure you
      understand the requirements and have a correct implementation plan before writing actual code.

      documentation-process
      After implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, make sure to document the changes. Use after finishing the implementation phase for a feature or a bug-fix.

      task-master-process
      Workflow for task-master-ai when working with task-master tasks and PRDs. Use when creating or parsing PRDs from requirements, adding/updating/expanding tasks and other task-master-ai operations.

      testing-process
      Guidelines describing how to test the code. Use whenever writing new or updating existing code, for example after implementing a new feature or fixing a bug.

      ---
      These skills provide specialized workflows for different stages of development. You can invoke any of them by asking me to use a specific skill (e.g., "use the analysis-process skill" or "help me document this feature").
    ```

5. Update the `README.md` with a full description of your project, then run `chmod +x bootstrap.sh && ./bootstrap.sh` to finalize initialization of the repo.

6. Profit

## Examples

Some examples of the actual claude-code workflows that were executed using templates, configs, skills, and other tools from this repository can be found in [examples](./examples) directory.
