Product Requirements Document: Language-Specific Development Skills

OVERVIEW
========

Add comprehensive language-specific development skills to the claude-starter-kit template that provide developers with immediate access to code style conventions, testing strategies, tooling guidance, and best practices for Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, and TypeScript.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

The current template includes process-based skills that are intentionally language-agnostic. While this maintains flexibility, it creates friction:
- Developers must repeatedly look up language-specific conventions and testing frameworks
- The %LANGUAGE% placeholder in testing-process provides minimal actionable guidance
- No centralized reference for language idioms within Claude Code workflow
- New contributors lack quick access to project language patterns and best practices

GOALS
=====

1. Provide language-specific guidance for the 5 most common languages: Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript
2. Integrate seamlessly with existing process skills without disrupting current workflows
3. Keep template lean by only including the relevant language skill per project
4. Enable extensibility for users to add framework-specific guidance as needed
5. Maintain practicality - focus on actionable insights, not encyclopedic documentation

NON-GOALS
=========

- Not creating language tutorials (assumes developer proficiency)
- Not documenting specific frameworks (core language focus with extensibility)
- Not providing API references (Claude can use Context7 for this)
- Not generating code templates or boilerplate

REQUIREMENTS
============

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

1. Language Skill Structure
   - Create dedicated skill for each supported language following naming convention: lang-<language>
   - Each skill must include:
     * SKILL.md - Entry point with overview, quick reference, navigation links
     * style.md - Code conventions, naming, formatting, project structure, idioms
     * testing.md - Testing frameworks, patterns, coverage, mocking strategies
     * tooling.md - Package managers, build tools, linters, formatters, debugging
     * patterns.md - Design patterns, anti-patterns, error handling, concurrency
     * frameworks/README.md - Instructions for adding optional framework guides
     * frameworks/.gitkeep - Ensures directory is tracked in git

2. Template Cleanup Integration
   - Workflow must accept LANGUAGE input parameter
   - Remove all lang-* directories except the one matching LANGUAGE input
   - Replace %LANGUAGE% placeholders with actual language name in process skills
   - Inject markdown links to language skill in testing-process and development-process
   - Validate LANGUAGE input against supported languages (go, python, java, kotlin, typescript)
   - Handle case-insensitive input (Go, GO, go all work)

3. Process Skill Integration
   - testing-process/SKILL.md must reference lang-<language>/testing.md
   - development-process/SKILL.md must reference lang-<language>/tooling.md
   - References should be markdown links, not import statements
   - Brief inline guidance plus link to full skill for deep dives
   - Natural reading flow when placeholders are replaced

4. Content Requirements
   - SKILL.md: 50-100 lines (lightweight overview + quick reference)
   - Topic files: 150-300 lines each (practical + comprehensive)
   - Focus on what's unique or commonly misunderstood about the language
   - Avoid framework comparisons (can be looked up elsewhere)
   - Avoid code examples for API usage (use Context7 instead)
   - Emphasize practical, actionable guidance over exhaustive coverage

5. Framework Extensibility
   - Each language skill includes empty frameworks/ directory
   - frameworks/README.md explains how to add framework-specific guides
   - Template ships without any framework content (keeps it lean)
   - Users add framework guides post-template as project-specific needs arise

Non-Functional Requirements
---------------------------

1. Maintainability
   - Consistent structure across all 5 language skills
   - Clear separation between core language and framework content
   - Easy to update content without touching workflow logic
   - Easy to add new languages following established pattern

2. Usability
   - Skills invoke naturally in Claude Code
   - Navigation links work correctly
   - Markdown formatting renders properly
   - Clear guidance on when to use each skill

3. Performance
   - Template cleanup workflow completes in under 2 minutes
   - No significant increase in repository size
   - Language skills don't bloat Claude Code context unnecessarily

4. Compatibility
   - Works with existing Claude Code skill invocation system
   - Compatible with current MCP server setup (Serena, Task Master, Context7, Zen)
   - Doesn't break existing process skill functionality
   - Backward compatible for projects created before this feature

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES
==================

Priority order:
1. Go - Strong typing, concurrency, stdlib focus
2. Python - Dynamic typing, ecosystem richness, multiple paradigms

USER EXPERIENCE
===============

During Project Creation
----------------------
1. User clicks "Use this template" on GitHub
2. Runs template-cleanup workflow with LANGUAGE input (e.g., "go")
3. Receives project with:
   - Only lang-go skill directory present
   - testing-process automatically references lang-go/testing.md
   - development-process automatically references lang-go/tooling.md
   - All %LANGUAGE% placeholders replaced with "Go"

During Development
-----------------
1. Invoke process skills normally (testing-process, development-process)
2. Follow inline brief guidance in process skills
3. Navigate to language skill for comprehensive guidance via markdown links
4. Directly invoke language skill: "Use the lang-go skill to help with..."
5. Extend with framework guides as needed in frameworks/ directory

Framework Extension Workflow
---------------------------
1. Developer identifies need for framework-specific guidance (e.g., Gin for Go)
2. Reads frameworks/README.md for instructions
3. Creates frameworks/gin.md following provided template
4. Documents framework patterns, testing approaches, project-specific conventions
5. Framework guide available for team reference within Claude Code

"Use Go best practices and well-established Go testing tools.

For comprehensive Go testing guidance including table-driven tests,
test coverage, and benchmark testing, see the `lang-go` skill at
[skills/lang-go/testing.md](./../lang-go/testing.md)."

4. Feedback quality - User reports on practical value
5. Maintenance overhead - Time to keep content current

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

RISKS & MITIGATIONS
==================

Risk: Content becomes outdated as languages evolve
Mitigation: Schedule quarterly content reviews, monitor language version updates

Risk: Inconsistent structure across language skills
Mitigation: Use templates, establish clear guidelines, code review process

Risk: Framework guidance bleeds into core language content
Mitigation: Clear boundaries documented, separate frameworks/ directory

Risk: Template-cleanup workflow failures
Mitigation: Robust input validation, comprehensive testing, clear error messages

Risk: Increased maintenance burden
Mitigation: Community contributions, automated checks for broken links, modular structure

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
====================

1. Multi-language project support - Accept comma-separated LANGUAGE values
2. Language version specificity - Include version-specific guidance (Go 1.23+, Python 3.12+)
3. Additional languages - Expand to Rust, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP based on demand
4. Automated content updates - Scripts to refresh tooling references
5. Community framework guides - Accept contributions for common frameworks
6. Cross-language patterns - Shared guidance for patterns common across languages

OPEN QUESTIONS
=============

1. Should we support multi-language projects from day one or wait for user demand?
   Recommendation: Wait for demand, start with single language per project

2. How frequently should we review content for accuracy?
   Recommendation: Quarterly reviews, major updates trigger immediate review

3. Should framework guides have a standard structure enforced by tooling?
   Recommendation: Provide template, enforce through documentation and code review

4. How do we handle language-specific linting configurations?
   Recommendation: Document in tooling.md, provide examples, don't include actual configs

5. Should we create a skill for shell scripting (Bash)?
   Recommendation: Defer until user demand is clear, focus on main programming languages first
