# Workflow Examples

Below are some examples of the actual claude-code workflows that were executed using templates, configs, skills, and other tools from this repository.

## Feature Design

> Refine and idea and turn it into a fully-documented design and implementation plan, complete with task-master PRD and tasks, and ready for implementation.

> [!TIP]
> After completing the design, I usually ask claude to run a code-review with zen to use gemini-2.5-pro model to proof-read the created documents before proceeding with implementation itself.
